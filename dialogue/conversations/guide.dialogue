Derek: [[Hi|Hello|Howdy]], welcome to Sprout Valley.
Derek: It is beautiful here, isn't it? But the land outside the valley is struggling with the changing climate.
Derek: We are trying to build a sanctuary here. A place where nature and people work together.
Derek: To do that, we need to restore the **Biodiversity**. Do you know what that means?
- Yes, nature needs variety!
	Cindy: It means we need a mix of different plants and animals, right?
	Derek: Exactly! Monocultures—growing just one thing—hurt the soil. A healthy ecosystem needs variety to survive.
- I'm not sure.
	Derek: It means having many different kinds of life. If we only plant one crop, the land gets sick. We need trees, flowers, and crops together.

Derek: I have some organic seeds here. They help pull carbon from the air and heal the soil.
- Take eco-seeds
	Cindy: I'm ready to help heal the land.
	do GameDialogueManager.action_give_crop_seeds()
	Derek: Wonderful. Remember, every tree you plant cools the earth a little bit more. Good luck, Guardian!
- No, I don't want them
	Cindy: I'm not ready to take on that responsibility yet.
	Derek: I understand. The climate waits for no one, though. Come back when you are ready to make a difference.
