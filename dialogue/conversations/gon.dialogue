Gon: [[Greetings|Hello there|Welcome]], young Guardian.
Gon: Look around you. The forest is quiet... too quiet. The ecosystem here is fragile.
Gon: I need someone to explore the outer woods and help restore the natural balance.
- I am ready to help!
	Gon: That is what I wanted to hear! 
	Gon: Your task is simple but important: Explore the area and identify what is harming the wildlife.
	=> restoration_instructions
- What exactly do I need to do?
	Gon: It is a mission of conservation. 
	Gon: You must explore the map to find areas where the habitat is degraded.
	Gon: Once found, you must remove the pollution and plant new flora to bring the animals back.

Gon: Here, take these tools.
